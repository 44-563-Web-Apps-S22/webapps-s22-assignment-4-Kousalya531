            Mme. Pernelle.  Let's go, Flipote, let's go.  I hate this place.
Elmire.  I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.
Mme. Pernelle.  Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.
        I don't wish to cause you any bother.
Elmire.  What duty demands, I insist on giving.
        But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?
Mme. Pernelle.  I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .
        And no one cares what I wish to have done.
        Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied
        For all my wise advice has been defied . . .
        And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,
        And truly this is a home for the king of louts!
Dorine.  If . . .
Mme. Pernelle.   You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,
        A little brazen and very sassy,
        You butt into everything to speak your mind.
Damis.  But . . .
Mme. Pernelle.    You, grandson, are a fool of the worst kind.
        It is I, your grandmother, that pronounce this edict
        And to my son, your father, I have oft predicted
        That you'll turn out to be a worthless wastrel,
        And give him in life a foretaste of Hell.
Mariane.  I think . . .
Mme. Pernelle.     My lord, his sister!  You seem so discreet
        And so untainted, so very sweet,
        But the stillest waters are filled with scum,
        And your sly ways earn my revulsion.
Elmire.  But . . .
Mme. Pernelle.     Daughter, my views may make you mad,
        But your conduct in all things is all bad.
        In your family's eyes you should be an example-setter;
        In that respect their late mother did far better.
        You are extravagant, and it wounds me, I guess,
        To see you sashay about dressed like a princess.
        A woman who wishes only to please her mate,
        Dear daughter, need not primp and undulate.
Cleante.  Madam, after all . . .
